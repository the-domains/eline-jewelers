Accessories are a common element of employee recognition programs, and they are presented to individuals as a symbol of an accomplishment. Like fraternity and sorority pins, these pieces instill a sense of belonging to an elite group of performers at the organization. Businesses also award to employees more frequently to boost employee morale, productivity and employee engagement.

Not to be confused with tie rod or <i>tie (typography)</i></p><p>Tie clips are commonly made of metal and often have decorative patterns or embellishments. Some clips have a small badge indicating membership to a club or some other affiliation, or some other commemorative token, in a similar manner to the way in which ties themselves may be used as signs of membership. The use of tie clips gained prominence during the 1920s, during which period the use of straight ties made of delicate materials such as silk became more fashionable, and they largely came to replace the more traditional tie pin. In the United States, a tie clip is one of the few items of jewelry allowed to be worn by servicemen and women.</p><p><i></i></p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bf1344d3-287d-4868-a8a0-2113a66f2e61.jpg" alt="" title="Corporate Metal Solutions"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0afebecc-1fb2-4564-bd59-e58e5e5cf96f.jpg" alt="" title=""><p><b></b></p><p><b>Emblemmatic Accessory Description</b></p><p>Lapel pins are frequently used as symbols of achievement and belonging in different organizations. Lapel pins from the organization are often collected by members and non-members alike. Also, coins, tie bars, belt buckles, earrings, brooches and much more are great emblematic jewelry pieces.</p><p>Businesses also use lapel pins to designate achievement and membership.

Businesses also award lapel pins to employees more frequently to boost employee morale, productivity and employee engagement.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Die Struck </b>The most popular method for making a lapel pin and other accessories, is a metal die striking the metal to put into shape by using an immense amount of pressure.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Cloisonné </b>Sometimes called hard enamel, cloisonné is stamped out from a sheet of copper. The stamping leaves recessed areas, or pools, which are filled with enamel powder and high fired at 800 - 900 degrees. After cooling, the surface of the pin is ground down to a smooth finish and then the copper is plated.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Soft enamel </b>This process is like cloisonné in that strips of metal separate areas of color. Unlike cloisonné, the areas of color rest below the metal strip surface, which can be felt when you run your finger over the surface. Like the photo etched process, the top can be covered with protective epoxy] so that the piece appears smooth.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Photo etched </b>In the photo etch process, only the shape of the piece is stamped out. The design on the face of the pin, is chemically etched into the base metal, then color-filled by hand and baked before being polished. In the final step, a thin coat of clear epoxy can be applied to the surface.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>4-Color process </b>4-colors process, a.k.a. offset printing, allows for bleeds and blends of colors, as is used in magazines. The colors are printed in the traditional CMYK process. This style can be used for complex art and photo reproduction. An unlimited amount of colors can be used.</p><p><b><u></u></b></p><p><u><b>Back Side of Pin [Attachment]</b></u></p><p>The backside of a lapel pin can be just as important to as the front, not only because it holds the pin in place, but also because it may make the pin more unusual. Attachment pieces come in a variety of styles.</p><p>Butterfly clutch - One of the most popular modern methods of attaching pins is the butterfly clutch, sometimes called a military clutch. The back of the pin has a small prong attached and when the butterfly clutch is squeezed and pulled up from the prong the pin is released from the clutch. Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.</p><p>Jewelry clutch - The jewelry clutch, or tie tack, is a simple but elegant design. The clutch locks into place when it covers the prong.</p><p>Safety clasp - A safety clasp is similar to a safety pin in design. A long pin prong tucks under a small hook or clasp to hold the pin in place.</p><p>Magnetic clasp - Magnetic clasps are composed of a small disc magnet that is attracted to another magnet that is attached to the back of the pin. Although this method is generally less secure, it is designed to prevent hole punctures in garments.</p><p>Screw and nut - A screw and nut clasp is one of the most secure. The prong is threaded so that the nut screws into place to hold the pin firmly.</p><p>Stick pin - A stick pin has a thin needle with a collar that slides up and down the needle to secure or release the pin</p><p>sales@CorporateMetalSolutions.com<br>ASI 51918 <br>888-509-1575</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="48"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="49"><span data-reactid="50"><!-- react-empty: 51 --><h2 data-reactid="52"><a data-reactid="53">Accessories</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="56"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="57"></div></section></div></div>
