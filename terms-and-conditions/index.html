<p><strong>Cancelled Orders</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to invoice on all cancelled orders. All costs incurred will be invoiced and at the buyers expense. A minimum of 45% plus time of production halted will be charged.</p><p>The greater of the two will be chosen. All cancelled orders must be emailed and called in, with a written confirmation from our office. Once the product has been completed, no returns or refunds will be granted.</p><p><strong>NO returns on finished work. Satisfaction Guaranteed though!</strong></p><p><strong>Returns</strong></p><p>Due to the custom nature of our product there are no returns or refunds. We are happy to assist with any warranty work.</p><p><strong>Payment Options</strong></p><p>All new orders are subject to 100% prepayment. Repeat orders require a 50% deposit with the remainder due one-week prior to ship date. This will automatically be charged to the credit card stated in your authorization:</p><p><em>“The "distributor" understand FINAL payment will be made/ paid one week prior to the ship date stated on the PROFORMA Invoice. Orders under $2,000 (net) are prepaid in full, unless special terms have been approved through becoming a preferred vendor.</em></p><p><em><strong>This is a commodity item and holds true value which is why prepayment is required to lock in the price of the precious metal at time of order to protect you, but also because this is a custom item payment is a key component of order approval.”</strong></em></p><p>We accept most credit cards, a fee of 1.8% and bank wires have a $30 transaction fee. Cheques are accepted but will delay an order by 5 to 15 business days until cleared.</p><p><strong>Precious Metal Prices &amp; Quotes</strong></p><p>The final prices of all orders are based on the time of order and all current market rates. If markets reflect a 7% increase, the order will adjust accordingly. All orders must be 60% pre-paid to secure pricing at the time of order. All quotes are provided within 24 hours at the time of request unless informed otherwise. Quotes are based on current market rates provided. This is a commodity item and holds true value, which is why we require a pre-payment to lock in the price of the precious metal at the time the order is placed. This not only protects you, but also, because this is a custom item, payment is a key component of order approval.</p><p><strong>Virtual Samples</strong></p><p>Free Virtual samples are provided upon request. Two (2) revisions will be allowed; all others will be invoiced $50.00(g). Vector or EPS are the only accepted formats.</p><p><strong>Samples</strong></p><p>Once a purchase order has been received with all details relating to the product has been sent, samples can be provided and sent out NEXT business day. Credit card information must be on file and the shipping number must be provided or an invoice will be sent accordingly and charged via credit card number. All samples are loaned on 15 business days</p><p> after which will be invoiced for the full (net) amount plus any other fees accrued.</p><p><strong>**Ask about Sample Kits**</strong></p><p>Errors and Corrections on Orders</p><p>If an error has been made and the fault is not of the factory, it is the distributor’s responsibility to cover all expenses and fee(s) to repair the product. All shipping, wages, and materials will be quoted and billed accordingly. If the factory has made error, we will repair and correct the problem at no charge.</p><p>Ring Sizing</p><p>CMS will provide ring-sizing kits at a fee of $20.00 (net) plus shipping; if the distributor declines to use our ring sizes we cannot guarantee proper and accurate sizes. For rings over 13-ring size, there is automatically an</p><p> OVER SIZE</p><p> fee that will be quoted at the time of order as it depends on metal markets and style of the ring.</p><p>Design Flaws</p><p>Design flaws occur in custom products. These can set back the in-hands date and the customer must be educated on the delay and how it is being fixed. When a design flaw occurs, CMS is not liable for missing a ship date, as this is not within our control.</p><p>Final Pricing</p><p>Due to the potential chance that precious metal markets may increase, all prices quoted are subject to change without notice. When pre-payment has been made on the order(s), the price is locked in based on the market rates at that time. If pre-payment has not been made, the price will not be locked in at the time the order has been made.</p><p><strong>This is a commodity item and holds true value, which is why pre-payment is required to lock in the price of the precious metal at the time the order is placed. This not only protects you, but also, because this is a custom item, payment is a key component of order approval.</strong></p><p><strong>Limited Warranty:</strong></p><p>Coverage</p><p>Cleaning of tarnished or discolored precious metal jewelry will be done at no charge. Shipping is not covered.</p><p>Re-sizing a/of ring(s) is charged at $35 per size change for Sterling silver, and $45 per size for gold. Stainless steel cannot be re-sized. Shipping is additional.</p><p>Refurbishing of scratched, dented, bent or misshaped precious metal jewelry will be quoted upon inspection; in most circumstances there is no charge on general cleaning. Shipping is additional.</p><p><strong>Not Covered</strong></p><p>Jewelry gift boxes are not covered under our warranty. Lost or stolen jewelry is not covered under our warranty, once an order is picked up by an approved courier [FedEx, UPS, Purolator, DHL, ICS] eLine Jewelers and its affiliates are no longer liable or responsible for the product. Distributors are encouraged to take additional insurance. Jewelry not bearing our Manufacturers quality mark is not covered under our warranty.</p><p>We cannot be held responsible for jewelry items missing in transit. All such claims should be directed to the appropriate courier.</p><p>Tampered or damaged jewelry is not covered but can be quoted for repair when it has arrived back to the factory.</p><p><strong>Caring for Your Precious Metal Jewellery</strong></p><p>Precious metal jewelry is, by definition, a luxury item and as such must be cared for properly to ensure it looks its best. We recommend that it be kept in the supplied gift box while not in use as this keeps it safe, and helps to inhibit tarnishing as it includes an anti-tarnish strip. All precious metal will eventually tarnish over time, although wearing it regularly pro-longs this natural occurring effect.
