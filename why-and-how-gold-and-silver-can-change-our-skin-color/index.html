class="Component color-text p-1" data-reactid="70"><div class="Content" data-reactid="71"><p>Why and How Gold and Silver can Change our Skin color…</p><p>Pure gold, also referred to as 24 karat or 24K, has many unique and desirable characteristics that make it valuable. For instance, it doesn’t tarnish, it is non-allergenic, it is very malleable/workable. Pure gold polishes to a mirror-like shine, it is rare, and it is highly valued in the world. However, it is very soft and pliable in its pure 24K state and is generally considered to be unsuitable for wedding bands and other jewelry.</p><p>In order to make gold jewelry that is durable and long lasting, gold is combined with other metals–called alloys–to make it stronger and change its color. Alloys add strength, but dilute the value of the gold and may cause jewelry items to eventually tarnish and/or cause allergic reactions. In an attempt to achieve the best balance between the strength of alloys and the valuable and desirable properties of gold, three different karat gold combinations have become standard: 18K, 14K, and 10K. All three of these karat golds are available in white gold or yellow gold. White gold alloys are typically stronger than yellow gold alloys, so a white gold ring will be slightly stronger and last a little longer than a yellow gold ring.</p><p>18K Gold contains 75% gold and 25% alloy. 18K gold is the softest and purist of these three karat golds and is the most expensive because of its high gold content. It is typically used in higher-end jewelry such as fancy diamond rings or where a richer yellow color is desired. For instance, when combined with platinum it can create a stunning and contrasting two-tone look. It is the most resistant to tarnishing of the three karat golds, and although it is the softest, it is still hard enough to be used for rings. 18K gold jewelry will show wear marks sooner and wear out slightly faster than 14K and 10K gold bands, but they are still the preferred choice of those wanting something a little finer.</p><p>14K Gold contains 58.3% gold and 41.7% alloy. 14K gold is generally considered to be the ideal karat gold for rings and wedding bands because it is strong yet will not easily tarnish. Probably 90% of all the gold rings sold in the United States–whether yellow gold or white gold–are made with 14K gold. It still has a good yellow color for those wanting yellow instead of white, and when choosing the best karat gold for jewelry based on all-around beauty and practicality, 14K gold can’t be beat.</p><p>10K Gold contains 41.7% gold and 58.3% alloy. 10K gold is the only karat gold that contains more alloy than gold. 10K gold rings are typically requested by individuals looking for a slight discount from 14K gold prices. It is the least pure and therefore the least expensive of the three karat golds and is the preferred metal for class rings and other jewelry pieces where a lower cost is desired. It will tarnish more quickly than 18K and 14K gold jewelry, and 10K yellow gold jewelry items are slightly more pale in color than 14K yellow gold jewelry items. 10K gold is generally considered to be harder than 14K, but there is much unresolved discussion within the jewelry industry about whether or not it actually wears longer than 14K.</p><p>With the internet making it possible to buy gold jewelry from anywhere in the world, many manufacturers are now using international gold marks to show the purity of their gold jewelry items. In these cases, the fineness of the precious metal content is expressed in parts-per-thousand. This marking system is universally recognized, is actually more accurate, and we have listed the applicable marks here along with their corresponding karat marks:</p><p>24K = .999<br> 18K = .750<br> 14K = .585<br> 10K = .417</p><p>White Gold Rings and Rhodium Plating</p><p><em>Because white gold is made from yellow gold and various alloys, white gold in it’s natural state has a slight yellow tint. It’s not a true white metal like platinum or silver. To enhance the whiteness of white gold jewelry, and no matter where you purchase white gold jewelry, it has become standard in the jewelry industry to plate (or cover) white gold jewelry with another metal called Rhodium. Rhodium is very white, reflective, and extremely hard and virtually tarnish free, so it’s the perfect protective coating for a white gold ring.</em></p><p>This Rhodium coating may eventually wear off and need to be re-applied through a simple re-plating process, if the bright, whiter look is desired for the piece of jewelry. If you are finding yourself having a reaction to one jewelry piece and not other gold pieces that does not mean it is not true karat, but the alloys within the ratio have more alloy than others that your body is perhaps allergic to with a chemical reaction. Also time of year and environment can play a big part in gold being reactive to your body chemistry.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="72"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="74"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="75"><span data-reactid="76"><!-- react-empty: 77 --><h2 data-reactid="78"><a data-reactid="79">Corporate Metal Solutions</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="80"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="81"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="82"><div class="Link" data-reactid="83"><a data-reactid="84">Contact Web Designer</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="85"></div></section></div></div>
