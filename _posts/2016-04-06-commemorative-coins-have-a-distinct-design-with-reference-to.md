**Commemorative coins **have a distinct design with reference to the occasion on which they were issued. Many coins of this category serve as collectors items only, while in corporate, schools, organizations they serve several purposes. 

Coins can come in all sizes, materials, and finishes. Here at CMS we can help you build the right piece for your client, to meet their budget, design requirements, as well provide the custom packaging that can also be imprinted.
