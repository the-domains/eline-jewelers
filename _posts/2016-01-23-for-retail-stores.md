Custom jewelry is a self-reflection with intent to impress those around you.  We work with you and our designers to ensure your customer's jewelry piece is designed with attention to detail and care.  With flexible and unique variables, custom jewelry is a fun and an exclusive way to build your jewelry store collection.

CMS takes custom jewelry to the next level with your client's budget in mind.  We create jewelry through artistic methods with the final draft being a full 3D image & videos, providing your store with the best presentation to your customers.  ![Wedding Band](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/49a20d2d23d0179e3a8b7ad03a1d7213cf317d3c.jpg)

We can help your retail store with designs, send you 3D \[cast-ready\] waxes, to even casting your jewelry for you, as well flat dies.  We can help with the following: design team, 3D Printing Department, to base metal castings, and precious metal castings.  We also have repair, and stone setting available.

Designing a ring/ jewelry piece can be time-consuming not to mention requires a lot of skill and training backed by very expensive software and training to ensure you have the best made model for your customers.  Many design companies feel they should charge huge fee's, we think otherwise and why CMS works with many small and large jewelry stores; helping them focus on sales while we handle their designs, and deliver any level within the design or making of jewelry.  From 3D Virtuals, to WRL. STL. You are in good hands when you let CMS do the prep-work for you.  If you require WRL. or STL. File repair. No problem!  If you require design work, and casting.  No Problem!  If you need even a proto-type sent before casting or waxes are sent.  No Problem!
