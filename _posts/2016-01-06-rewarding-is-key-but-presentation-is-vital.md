* Rewarding an employee in front of the entire staff boosts their personal confidence, which is beneficial for the company.
* It also affects the psychology of the workers who haven't been performing well. It increases the morale of the less hard working employees to work hard, in order to get the credit and appreciation.
* It motivates the staff and their conviction in the organization they are working for, resulting in a better and focused team.
* Acknowledging also binds the staff under loyalty and experienced employees are more valuable than any asset of the company.
* It also provides an opportunity to the employer to know the members of the staff personally.
