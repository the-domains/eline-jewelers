**Bullet Back and Toggle Closures**The bullet back and toggle backings are the easiest to put on
and are the most common. The backing is in the shape of a bullet suspended
between two posts. The bullet can be flipped vertically 90 degrees so that it
lines up with the posts, making it easy to insert through the button holes. The
bullet is then flipped back to the horizontal position, securing the cufflink
in place.

**Whale Back Closure**This style of cufflink offers a subtle
deviation from the classic bullet back or toggle cufflink style, featuring a
straight post with a flat "whale tail" attached at the end. Relatively easy to
handle thanks to the size, shape and weight of the tail, the whale closure
flips flat against the post to insert into the button holes. The tail then
flips back horizontal securing the cufflink in place.

**Fixed Backing**The fixed backing is an extension of the cufflink.
This means that the cufflink post and backing are one solid piece and affixed
to the back of the cufflink face. The backing does not move and depending on
the shape of the backing (rounded or pointed) could be a little harder to
insert. However, since there are no moving parts, this style is more resilient
in the long run. Fixed backing cuff links can come in reversible varieties.
Reversible cufflinks have a design on both sides which allows you to switch
which side you want to feature.

**Chain Link**The chain link cufflink is the original
cufflink design. In this design, the two sides of the cufflink are joined
together with a chain link. Chain link cufflinks take more dexterity and
agility to put on. The benefit of this design is that there something
attractive to look at on both sides of the cuff. Also, the flexibility of the
chain link allows for a looser cuff. Chain link cufflinks can also come in reversible
varieties

**Ball Return**same as
fixed just ballBall return backings offer the best of both
worlds with a more elegant cufflink closure that comes in chain link or fixed
styles. The ball cuff link type is often considered a more attractive backing
than the bullet or toggle closures. It's a great choice for the experienced
wearer, and for those with more specific and defined tastes in fashion
accessories.
