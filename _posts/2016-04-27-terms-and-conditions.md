_Errors and Corrections on Orders_

If an error has been made and the fault is not of the factory, it is the distributor's responsibility to cover all expenses and fee(s) to repair the product. All shipping, wages, and materials will be quoted and billed accordingly. If the factory has made error, we will repair and correct the problem at no charge.

_Ring Sizing_

CMS will provide ring-sizing kits at a fee of $20.00 (net) plus shipping; if the distributor declines to use our ring sizes we cannot guarantee proper and accurate sizes. For rings over 13-ring size, there is automatically an 

_OVER SIZE_

fee that will be quoted at the time of order as it depends on metal markets and style of the ring.

_Design Flaws_

Design flaws occur in custom products. These can set back the in-hands date and the customer must be educated on the delay and how it is being fixed. When a design flaw occurs, eLine Jewellers is not liable for missing a ship date, as this is not within our control.

_Final Pricing_

Due to the potential chance that precious metal markets may increase, all prices quoted are subject to change without notice. When pre-payment has been made on the order(s), the price is locked in based on the market rates at that time. If pre-payment has not been made, the price will not be locked in at the time the order has been made. 

**This is a commodity item and holds true value, which is why pre-payment is required to lock in the price of the precious metal at the time the order is placed. This not only protects you, but also, because this is a custom item, payment is a key component of order approval.**

**_Caring for Your Precious Metal Jewellery_**

Precious metal jewelry is, by definition, a luxury item and as such must be cared for properly to ensure it looks its best. We recommend that it be kept in the supplied gift box while not in use as this keeps it safe, and helps to inhibit tarnishing as it includes an anti-tarnish strip. All precious metal will eventually tarnish over time, although wearing it regularly pro-longs this natural occurring effect. We recommend using liquid silver cleaner to easily remove any tarnishing that does occur.
