Building a successful President's Club program is crucial for "corporate leader identity" presented at a jubilee gala separating this award from all others as the most distinguished valuable award within corporate synergy.  Everything from design, to presentation are key essentials to a successful program.  The President's Club Ring identifies leaders who have dedicated themselves to the beliefs and fundamentals as well the synergy the corporation has been founded on and lives by.  These people already have the homes, cars, as well travel they ever wanted but like all Dukes and Duchess; the jewel of the kingdom needs to be officially worn on one's finger to truly feel part of the elitists.
