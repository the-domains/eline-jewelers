Building a successful President's Club program is crucial for "corporate leader identity" presented at a jubilee gala separating this award from all others as the most distinguished valuable award within corporate synergy.  Everything from design, to presentation are key essentials to a successful program.  The President's Club Ring identifies leaders who have dedicated themselves to the beliefs and fundamentals as well the synergy the corporation has been founded on and lives by.  These people already have the homes, cars, as well travel they ever wanted but like all Dukes and Duchess; the jewel of the kingdom needs to be officially worn on one's finger to truly feel part of the elitists.

eLine Jewellers works with our distributors to establish a well-rounded program that explicitly draws the attention at the office; as well those who are curious about the person ordering their "STARBUCKS" with such a powerful image on his or her finger that so well fits perfectly with one's power-suit that compliments all powerhouse figures.  This is just not a ring, it is "The" lighthouse for those to follow who want corporate success; while those wearing the ring become leaders as well a mentor to the next generation to ensure success follows even in our graceful years of retirement.  Leaving behind a strong-legacy for generations to come.
