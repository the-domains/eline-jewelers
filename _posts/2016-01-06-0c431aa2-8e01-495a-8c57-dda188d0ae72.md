Building a successful President's Club program is crucial for "corporate leader identity" presented at a jubilee gala separating this award from all others as the most distinguished valuable award within corporate synergy.  Everything from design, to presentation are key essentials to a successful program.  The President's Club Ring identifies leaders who have dedicated themselves to the beliefs and fundamentals as well the synergy the corporation has been founded on and lives by.
