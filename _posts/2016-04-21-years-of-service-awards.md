Everything from signet rings, classic styles, to accessories. Here at CMS we are dedicated to working with our loyal distributor fan base who take the extra time to appreciate the fine details for such programs, especially when working with jewelry.

Jewelry is a great way to show tier level achievement through stones, visual wording on jewelry pieces, or in a series of jewelry pieces that progress over the course of the employee's years with the company. You can even help your budget minded client's by using the same piece of jewelry by adding more stones.

No matter the design, budget, or custom work required; we look forward to helping you grow your client's jewelry program.
