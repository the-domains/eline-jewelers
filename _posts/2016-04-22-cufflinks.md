# Cufflinks

Cufflinks can be made to meet most budgets, styles, as well as fashion sense! Your client's will love know they can use the same mold to create a cufflinks, tie bar, lapel pin to maximize their budget. Cufflinks are available in all metal options, with stones and color as well over 8 different finished to help make their corporate cufflinks a success. Even customize the shape, or bullet backing!

Cufflinks are used to secure button shirt cuffs and may also be an item of jewelry for boys and men. Cufflinks can be manufactured from a variety of different materials, such as glass, stone, leather, metal, precious metal or combinations of these. Of course the most popular is stainless steel, sterling silver, 10KT Gold, and Gold plating.

Securing of the cufflinks is usually achieved via toggles or reverses based on the design of the front section, which can be folded into position. In addition, there are also variants with chains or a rigid, bent rear section. The front sections of the cufflinks can be decorated with gemstones, inlays, inset material or enamel and designed in two or three-dimensional form.

Cufflinks are designed only for use with shirts which have buttonholes on both sides but no buttons. These may be either single or double-length ("French") cuffs, and may be worn either "kissing," with the ends pinched together, or "barrel-style," with one end overlapping the other.

The visible part of a cufflink is often monogrammed or decorated in some way, such as with a birthstone or something which reflects a hobby or association. There are numerous styles including novelty, traditional, or contemporary.

**Die Struck **The most popular method for making a lapel pin and other accessories, is a metal die striking the metal to put into shape by using an immense amount of pressure.

**Cloisonné **Sometimes called hard enamel, cloisonné is stamped out from a sheet of copper. The stamping leaves recessed areas, or pools, which are filled with enamel powder and high fired at 800 - 900 degrees. After cooling, the surface of the pin is ground down to a smooth finish and then the copper is plated.

**Soft enamel **This process is like cloisonné in that strips of metal separate areas of color. Unlike cloisonné, the areas of color rest below the metal strip surface, which can be felt when you run your finger over the surface. Like the photo etched process, the top can be covered with protective epoxy\] so that the piece appears smooth.

**Photo etched **In the photo etch process, only the shape of the piece is stamped out. The design on the face of the pin, is chemically etched into the base metal, then color-filled by hand and baked before being polished. In the final step, a thin coat of clear epoxy can be applied to the surface.

**Photo Dome **This process begins by printing the art or design on vinyl or paper and then applying it to a metal pin base. The vinyl is then coated with an epoxy dome that protects the art from wear and the elements. This process is gaining in popularity because of advances in printing resolutions and the ability to complete these pins quickly in the United States.

**Screen printed**Screen printing, a.k.a. silk screening is produced by applying each color to the metal base using a "silk screen" process. These are blocks of solid color.A very thin epoxy coat protects the color material from scratching.

**4-Color process**4-colors process, a.k.a. offset printing, allows for bleeds and blends of colors, as is used in magazines. The colors are printed in the traditional CMYK process. This style is can be used for complex art and photo reproduction. An unlimited amount of colors can be used.
